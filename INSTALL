Instructions on installing ant
------------------------------

If /path/to/ant is the top level directory of ANT then pass the following to flint2 configure (along with the usual options for your system):

./configure --extensions=/path/to/ant

Then as usual, the following ought to work:

make
make check
make install

For further information refer to the flint2 documentation (see http://flintlib.org)
