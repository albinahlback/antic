ANTIC -- Algebraic Number Theory In C
======================================

Antic is an algebraic number theory library.

The only dependency at present is flint2 (see http://flintlib.org).

To install Antic, clone the repository into a directory on your filesystem, e.g. /home/username/antic

Now build flint in the usual way, passing --extensions=/home/username/antic to flint's configure.

The usual make, make check, make install, make clean, etc. apply.
